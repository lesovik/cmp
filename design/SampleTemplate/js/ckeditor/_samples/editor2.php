$text="[stage]Enter [char:Friar Lawrence] with lantern, crow, and spade

[char:Friar Lawrence]Saint Francis be my speed! how oft tonight
[center]Have my old feet stumbl’d at graves! Who’s there?
[char:Balthasar]Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
[char:Friar Lawrence]Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
[line:125]What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
[char:Balthasar]It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
One that you love.
[char:Friar Lawrence][continue]Who is it?
[char:Balthasar][continue]Romeo.
[line:130][char:Friar Lawrence]How long hath he been there?
[char:Balthasar][continue]Full half an hour.
[char:Friar Lawrence]Go with me to the vault.
[char:Balthasar][continue]I dare not, sir.
My master knows not but I am gone hence,
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.
[line:135][char:Friar Lawrence]Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
[char:Balthasar]As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.[exit:Retires]
[char:Friar Lawrence][continue]Romeo!

[stage][char:Friar] stoops and looks on the blood and weapons

[line:140]Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?

[stage]Enters the tomb

Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
[line:145]And steep’d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!

[stage][char:Juliet] rises

The lady stirs.
[char:Juliet]O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be;
[line:150]And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

[stage]Noise within

[char:Friar Lawrence]I hear some noise, lady. Come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
[line:155]Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the Watch is coming.
Come go, good Juliet, I dare no longer stay.[exit:Exit]
[line:160][char:Juliet]Go get thee hence, for I will not away.
What’s here? a cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
Poison I see hath been his timeless end.
O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips,
[line:165]Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warm.
[char:Captain of the Watch]{Within} Lead, boy, which way?
[char:Juliet]Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger,

[stage]Taking [char:Romeo]’s dagger

[line:170]This is thy sheath;

[stage]Stabs herself

[continue]there rust, and let me die.

[stage]Falls on [char:Romeo]’s body and dies

[stage]Enter [char:Paris]’s [char:Boy] and [char:Watch]

[char:Page]This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.
[char:Captain of the Watch]The ground is bloody, search about the churchyard.
Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.
[exit:Exeunt some of the Watch]
[stage][char:The Captain] enters the tomb and returns

Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain,
[line:175]And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Go tell the prince, run to the Capulets,
Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
[exit:Exeunt others of the [char:Watch]]
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
[line:180]But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

[stage]Enter one of the [char:Watch] with [char:Romeo]’s man [char:Balthasar]

[char:Second Watchman]Here’s Romeo’s man, we found him in the churchyard.
[char:Captain of the Watch]Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.

[stage]Enter [char:Friar Lawrence] and another [char:Watchman]

[char:Third Watchman]Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
[line:185]We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard’s side.
[char:Captain of the Watch]A great suspicion. Stay the friar too.

[stage]Enter the [char:Prince] with others

[char:Prince]What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning rest?

[stage]Enter [char:Capels], [char:Capulet], [char:Lady Capulet]

[line:190][char:Capulet]What should it be that is so shriek’d abroad?
[char:Lady Capulet]O, the people in the street cry ‘Romeo’,
Some ‘Juliet’, and some ‘Paris’, and all run
With open outcry toward our monument.
[char:Prince]What fear is this which startles in your ears?
[line:195][char:Captain of the Watch]Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill’d.
[char:Prince]Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
[char:Captain of the Watch]Here is a friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
[line:200]With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men’s tombs.

[stage][char:Capulet] and [char:Lady Capulet] enter the tomb

[char:Capulet]O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mistane, for lo his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,
[line:205]And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom!
[char:Lady Capulet]O me, this sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

[stage]They return from the tomb

[stage]Enter [char:Montague]

[char:Prince]Come, Montague, for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir now early down.
[line:210][char:Montague]Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight;
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
[char:Prince]Look and thou shalt see.

[stage][char:Montague] enters the tomb and returns

[char:Montague]O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
[line:215]To press before thy father to a grave?
[char:Prince]Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
And then will I be general of your woes,
[line:220]And lead you even to death. Mean time forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
[char:Friar Lawrence]I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
[line:225]Doth make against me, of this direful murder;
And here I stand both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
[char:Prince]Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
[char:Friar Lawrence]I will be brief, for my short date of breath
[line:230]Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife:
I married them, and their stol’n marriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
[line:235]Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth’d and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
[line:240]And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her (so tutor’d by my art)
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
[line:245]As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
[line:250]But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay’d by accident, and yesternight
Return’d my letter back. Then all alone,
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
[line:255]Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awakening, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
[line:260]She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience.
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
And she too desperate would not go with me,
But as it seems, did violence on herself.
[line:265]All this I know, and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.
[line:270][char:Prince]We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man? what can he say to this?
[char:Balthasar]I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
[line:275]This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not and left him there.
[char:Prince]Give me the letter, I will look on it.
Where is the County’s page that rais’d the Watch?
[line:280]Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
[char:Page]He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my master drew on him,
[line:285]And then I ran away to call the Watch.
[char:Prince]This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
[line:290]Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague?
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I for winking at your discords too
[line:295]Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
[char:Capulet]O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
Can I demand.
[char:Montague][continue]But I can give thee more,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
[line:300]That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
[char:Capulet]As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
[line:305][char:Prince]A glooming peace this morning with it brings,
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
[line:310]Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.[exit:Exeunt omnes]";
